That&apos;s primarily what the curator discussion studio was created for, and it would prevent drama from starting about the criticism. Generally, disagreements in the curator discussion studio are respectful and constructive, and it would prevent it from turning into a studio-wide conflict.","datetime_created":"2022-07-22T17:36:47.000Z","datetime_modified":"2022-07-22T17:36:47.000Z","visibility":"visible","author":{"id":27265189,"username":"DogCatPuppyLover","scratchteam":false,"image":"https://cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/user/27265189_60x60.png"},"reply_count":1}]
